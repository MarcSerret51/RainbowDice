    <description>Welcome to the mod page of the Rainbow Dice mod developed for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance by Vesperon 51.

The item
This dice is a quality 3 active item with 6 charges that rerolls all the items in a room (like the old D6) to items with the same (sometimes similar) color. For example: Rolls Lord of The Pit to Brimstone or Yum Heart. You can find the Rainbow Dice at treasure room and inside a secret room.


Color pools
The mod uses 7 different custom pools to organize the items based on the item color:
Red pool (Blood Clot, Champion Belt...)
Blue pool (Restock, Pisces...)
Brown and flesh (The Bible, R Key...)
Grey, white and black (Dry Baby, Death Touch...)
Pink and purple (Continuum, IPECAC...)
Yellow and orange (Crickets Head, How to Jump...)
Green (Gnawed Leaf, Poke Go...)
And a secret pool with a few items...


Others
You can roll the angels pieces and the tainted path knife to other items but you can't obtain this special items rolling others.
You can't get tainted items like Recall or Hold.
You can't roll the Dad's note.


Reports and suggestions
Please report any bug or suggestion (change item color pool for example) in the mod workshop forum or in this repository.
